## API

### App

The `App` class is the main class that can be extended by your app and bootstrapped.

#### `static bootstrap(): Promise<void>`

This method bootstraps the application by resolving the application class and calling the event methods.

### Events

When app is bootstrapped, it goes through a series of events. The following events are available:

- `BeforeInit` - Called before the application is initialized
- `OnInit` - Called when the application is initialized
- `AfterInit` - Called after the application is initialized

- `BeforeStart` - Called before the application is started
- `OnStart` - Called when the application is started
- `AfterStart` - Called after the application is started

- `BeforeShutdown` - Called before the application is shutdown
- `OnShutdown` - Called when the application is shutdown
- `AfterShutdown` - Called after the application is shutdown

### Decorators

The following decorators are available:

- `BeforeInit` - Marks a method as a event method that is called before the application is initialized
- `Init` - Marks a method as a event method that is called when the application is initialized
- `AfterInit` - Marks a method as a event method that is called after the application is initialized

- `BeforeStart` - Marks a method as a event method that is called before the application is started
- `Start` - Marks a method as a event method that is called when the application is started
- `AfterStart` - Marks a method as a event method that is called after the application is started

- `BeforeShutdown` - Marks a method as a event method that is called before the application is shutdown
- `Shutdown` - Marks a method as a event method that is called when the application is shutdown
- `AfterShutdown` - Marks a method as a event method that is called after the application is shutdown
