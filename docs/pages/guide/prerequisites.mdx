# Prerequisites

Before you start with BunyJS, there are a few prerequisites that you need to have:

## TypeScript

BunyJS is written in TypeScript, and it uses decorators, You need to enable decorators in your TypeScript configuration.

```json {3-4}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```

## IoC Pattern

BunyJS uses the Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern, so you need to have a basic understanding of this pattern. IoC is a design principle which helps to invert the control of object creation.

Learn more about IoC in the [IoC Container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) Wikipedia page.
